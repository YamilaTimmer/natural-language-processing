Measuring cancer evolution from the genome Abstract
The temporal dynamics of cancer evolution remain elusive, because it is impractical to longitudinally observe cancers unperturbed by treatment. Consequently, our knowledge of how cancers grow largely derives from inferences made from a single point in time - the endpoint in the cancer's evolution, when it is removed from the body and studied in the laboratory. Fortuitously however, the cancer genome, by virtue of ongoing mutations that uniquely mark clonal lineages within the tumour, provides a rich, yet surreptitious, record of cancer development. In this review, we describe how a cancer's genome can be analysed to reveal the temporal history of mutation and selection, and discuss why both selective and neutral evolution feature prominently in carcinogenesis. We argue that selection in cancer can only be properly studied once we have some understanding of what the absence of selection looks like. We review the data describing punctuated evolution in cancer, and reason that punctuated phenotype evolution is consistent with both gradual and punctuated genome evolution. We conclude that, to map and predict evolutionary trajectories during carcinogenesis, it is critical to better understand the relationship between genotype change and phenotype change.

What Is Cancer? Abstract
This essay focuses on themes in Explaining Cancer: Finding Order in Disorder (2018) by Anya Plutynski, a monograph that has important things to say about both the peculiarities of cancers and our theories about them. Cancer's agents of destruction are human cells that have been recruited and to some extent transformed into pathological organisms or the building blocks of tumors. Cancers both undermine and exploit mechanisms of multicellular organization, and understanding them gives rise to difficult philosophical problems. In addition to sketching Plutynski's discussion of these problems, this essay defends Christopher Boorse's account of disease from Plutynski's criticisms, and it expresses some qualms about her treatment of scientific explanation.
Field cancerization in breast cancer Abstract
Breast cancer affects one in seven women worldwide during their lifetime. Widespread mammographic screening programs and education campaigns allow for early detection of the disease, often during its asymptomatic phase. Current practice in treatment and recurrence monitoring is based primarily on pathological evaluations but can also encompass genomic evaluations, both of which focus on the primary tumor. Although breast cancer is one of the most studied cancers, patients still recur at a rate of up to 15% within the first 10 years post-surgery. Local recurrence was originally attributed to tumor cells contaminating histologically normal (HN) tissues beyond the surgical margin, but advances in technology have allowed for the identification of distinct aberrations that exist in the peri-tumoral tissues themselves. One leading theory to explain this phenomenon is the field cancerization theory. Under this hypothesis, tumors arise from a field of molecularly altered cells that create a permissive environment for malignant evolution, which can occur with or without morphological changes. The traditional histopathology paradigm dictates that molecular alterations are reflected in the tissue phenotype. However, the spectrum of inter-patient variability of normal breast tissue may obfuscate recognition of a cancerized field during routine diagnostics. In this review, we explore the concept of field cancerization focusing on HN peri-tumoral tissues: we present the pathological and molecular features of field cancerization within these tissues and discuss how the use of peri-tumoral tissues can affect research. Our observations suggest that pathological and molecular evaluations could be used synergistically to assess risk and guide the therapeutic management of patients. © 2022 The Authors.

Signaling, cancer cell plasticity, and intratumor heterogeneity Abstract
Cancer's complexity is in part due to the presence of intratumor heterogeneity and the dynamic nature of cancer cell plasticity, which create substantial obstacles in effective cancer management. Variability within a tumor arises from the existence of diverse populations of cancer cells, impacting the progression, spread, and resistance to treatments. At the core of this variability is the concept of cellular plasticity - the intrinsic ability of cancer cells to alter their molecular and cellular identity in reaction to environmental and genetic changes. This adaptability is a cornerstone of cancer's persistence and progression, making it a formidable target for treatments. Emerging studies have emphasized the critical role of such plasticity in fostering tumor diversity, which in turn influences the course of the disease and the effectiveness of therapeutic strategies. The transformative nature of cancer involves a network of signal transduction pathways, notably those that drive the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and metabolic remodeling, shaping the evolutionary path of cancer cells. Despite advancements, our understanding of the precise molecular machinations and signaling networks driving these changes is still evolving, underscoring the necessity for further research. This editorial presents a series entitled "Signaling Cancer Cell Plasticity and Intratumor Heterogeneity" in Cell Communication and Signaling, dedicated to unraveling these complex processes and proposing new avenues for therapeutic intervention.
Mapping cancer origins Abstract
Cancer comprises a bewildering assortment of diseases that kill 7.5 million people each year. Poor understanding of cancer's diversity currently thwarts our goal of a cure for every patient, but recent integration of genomic and stem cell technologies promises a route through this impasse.
Detection of Cancer DNA in Early Stage and Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients Abstract
Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer in women and the second leading cause of cancer-related death. There are many subtypes of breast cancer, which can be identified through the process of molecular and genetic profiling. While the current standard of care utilizes tumor tissue biopsy to subclassify breast cancer, plasma tumor DNA (ptDNA) can be detected through droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) of plasma obtained from a simple blood draw. Tissue biopsy is not only more invasive but because tumors exhibit heterogeneity it can be less accurate. Blood collects DNA shed from normal and cancerous cells alike, thus ddPCR of plasma offers a broader picture of a cancer's genetic makeup. This chapter summarizes how patients with breast cancer can be screened for specific cancerous mutations in both tissue and plasma through the use of ddPCR.
Breast Cancer: A Heterogeneous Pathology. Prognostic and Predictive Factors - A Narrative Review Abstract
Breast cancer (BC) is recognized as one of the leading malignancies affecting women worldwide. Its remarkable heterogeneity is a defining characteristic, contributing to both diverse patterns of disease progression and varied therapeutic responses. This review explores the evolution of breast cancer classifications, focusing on key prognostic and predictive factors. It examines traditional systems, such as the TNM staging and histological differentiation, while also incorporating modern elements like molecular subtypes, genomic alterations, and advanced diagnostic assays. By combining classical clinicopathological insights with cutting-edge molecular genetic technologies, the goal is to refine the precision of treatment strategies, ultimately advancing both our understanding and management of this complex disease. The review also emphasizes the importance of a global perspective, as achieving the primary treatment goals - prolonged survival and enhanced quality of life - requires addressing the disease in a broader, more comprehensive context. Breast cancer's complexity, driven by significant variability both across and within tumors, presents major challenges to conventional diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. However, breakthroughs in genomic research, such as molecular profiling and genetic testing, have deepened our understanding of this cancer's intricate nature. These advances have led to the identification of critical genetic alterations - including mutations in BRCA1/2, TP53, PALB2, PTEN, and PIK3CA - that profoundly impact tumor behavior, treatment efficacy, and patient prognosis. Genomic assays like Oncotype DX, MammaPrint, PROSIGNA, and EndoPredict offer valuable insights into recurrence risks and treatment choices, underscoring the growing importance of precision medicine. Moreover, the implementation of Molecular Tumor Boards further enhances personalized treatment strategies, contributing to improved patient outcomes and survival rates. This review underscores the significance of tailored therapeutic approaches and highlights the dynamic evolution of breast cancer in clinical practice.
Pediatric Cancer Genetics and Genomics Abstract
Molecular profiling of DNA and RNA from pediatric cancers by next-generation sequencing has been demonstrated to improve diagnosis and prognosis and to identify somatic alterations indicating vulnerability to targeted therapies. Hence, much like in the treatment of adult cancers, molecular profiling is now routinely utilized in clinical workflows for pediatric cancers as a companion to conventional pathology diagnosis. Many variants of unknown significance identified through DNA profiling are being characterized by saturation genome editing, enabled by CRISPR editing technology and clever functional assays. Newer technologies and analytics are revealing additional structural complexity around cancer drivers and gene fusions in pediatric cancer DNA. Similarly, computational methods such as rare variant association studies and polygenic risk scoring are being used to identify novel cancer susceptibility. Together, these advances are expanding our understanding of pediatric cancer's complexity and fueling the development of emerging methods such as liquid biopsy-based monitoring.

Epidemiology of Cancer Abstract
Background: Cancers are a large and heterogeneous group of malignant tumors that collectively accounted for approximately 600 000 US deaths in 2020; only heart disease claimed more lives. A large amount of knowledge has accumulated regarding the epidemiology of most cancer types, including their causes.

Content: The cancer types most frequently diagnosed among adults in most high-income countries are lung, colorectal, female breast, cutaneous melanoma, and prostate. In general cancer incidence and mortality is very low in children and adolescents, rising exponentially with increasing age during adulthood. There is marked international variation in the incidence of most cancers. The most important causes of cancer are tobacco use (primarily cigarette use), excess alcohol consumption, obesity, lack of physical activity, diets low in fruits and vegetables, infectious agents, and sun exposure. Early detection can reduce the chances that a person will die of cancers of the female breast, uterine cervix, colon and rectum, lung, and prostate.

Summary: Although the most common cancers in the United States continue to have a substantial impact on public health, they are caused in whole or part by factors over which people and governments have control through choices they make. Among these are tobacco and alcohol use, obesity, diets low in fruits and vegetables and lack of physical activity, and sun exposure. Thus, a very large proportion of cancer's impact could be ameliorated if more people avoided these exposures.
Colorectal Cancer in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Mechanisms and Management Abstract
Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at increased risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC), despite decreases in CRC incidence in recent years. Chronic inflammation is the driver of neoplastic progression, resulting in dysplastic precursor lesions that may arise in multiple areas of the colon through a process of field cancerization. Colitis-associated CRC shares many molecular similarities with sporadic CRC, and preclinical investigations have demonstrated a potential role for the microbiome in concert with the host immune system in the development of colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC). Some unique molecular differences occur in CAC, but their role in the pathogenesis and behavior of inflammation-associated cancers remains to be elucidated. Nonconventional types of dysplasia have been increasingly recognized, but their natural history is not well defined, and they have not been incorporated into surveillance algorithms. The concept of cumulative inflammatory burden highlights the importance of considering histologic inflammation over time as an important risk factor for CAC. Dysplasia is arguably the most important risk factor for developing CAC, and advances have been made in the endoscopic detection and removal of precancerous lesions, thereby deferring or avoiding surgical resection. Some of the agents used to treat IBD are chemopreventive. It is hoped that by gaining better control of the underlying inflammation with newer medications and better endoscopic detection and management, a more sophisticated appreciation of clinicopathologic risk factors, and growing awareness of the genetic, immunologic, and environmental causes of colitis- associated neoplasia, that colitis-associated colorectal neoplasia will become even more predictable and manageable in the coming years.
Esophageal Cancer: Overview, Risk Factors, and Reasons for the RiseAbstract
Purpose of review: Esophageal cancer (EC) is a common cancer affecting many regions of the world and carries significant morbidity and mortality. In this article, we review the key risk factors and their associated impact on the changing incidence and prevalence of EC subtypes within different global regions. We also highlight potential reasons for the ever-changing epidemiology of this prevalent cancer type.

Recent findings: There has been a shift in incidence of Esophageal Adenocarcinoma (AC) and Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) within certain populations primarily due to an increase prevalence of primary risk factors. In Western nations, more often the United States, there has been a shift from SCC predominance to the majority of new cases of EC being adenocarcinoma. This shift within the United States has largely correlated with a rise in obesity. The prevalence of AC in Asia is also starting to rise as more countries adopt a western diet. The pathophysiology, associated risk factors, and presentation of ESCC and AC are different. This difference is seen in varying lifestyles, population health, and certain genetic risks. With further development closer analysis of primary risk factors and implementation of policies and programs that promote public health literacy, there is a potential to decrease esophageal cancer's global disease burden.
Metabolic adaptation in hypoxia and cancer Abstract
The ability of tumor cells to adapt to changes in oxygen tension is essential for tumor development. Low oxygen concentration influences cellular metabolism and, thus, affects proliferation, migration, and invasion. A focal point of the cell's adaptation to hypoxia is the transcription factor HIF1α (hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha), which affects the expression of specific gene networks involved in cellular energetics and metabolism. This review illustrates the mechanisms by which HIF1α-induced metabolic adaptation promotes angiogenesis, participates in the escape from immune recognition, and increases cancer cell antioxidant capacity. In addition to hypoxia, metabolic inhibition of 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases regulates HIF1α stability and transcriptional activity. This phenomenon, known as pseudohypoxia, is frequently used by cancer cells to promote glycolytic metabolism to support biomass synthesis for cell growth and proliferation. In this review, we highlight the role of the most important metabolic intermediaries that are at the center of cancer's biology, and in particular, the participation of these metabolites in HIF1α retrograde signaling during the establishment of pseudohypoxia. Finally, we will discuss how these changes affect both the development of cancers and their resistance to treatment.
