Cancer cells accumulate many genetic alterations throughout their lifetime but only few of them drive cancer progression, these are so called driver mutations. Driver mutations may vary between cancer types and patients, can remain latent for a long time and become drivers at certain cancer stages, or may drive oncogenesis only in conjunction with other mutations. The high mutational, biochemical, and histological tumor heterogeneity makes driver mutation experimental identification and computational prediction very challenging. In this review we summarize the most recent efforts to identify driver mutations in cancer and annotate their effects. We underline the success of computational methods to predict driver mutations in finding novel cancer biomarkers, including in circulating tumor DNA. We also report on boundaries of their applicability for clinical research.
