Fibromyalgia, a chronic pain condition marked by abnormal pain processing, impacts a significant part of the population, leading to reduced quality of life and function. Hallmark symptoms include widespread persistent pain, sleep disturbances, fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, and mood changes. Through this updated review, we aim to contribute to the evolving understanding and management of fibromyalgia, offering insights into the diverse tools available to improve the lives of those affected by this challenging condition. Management begins with educating patients to ultimately relieve them of unnecessary testing and provide reassurance. Treatment emphasizes a comprehensive approach, combining nonpharmacological interventions such as aforementioned education, exercise, and psychotherapy, alongside pharmacologic management—namely duloxetine, milnacipran, pregabalin, and amitriptyline—which have consistent benefits for a range of symptoms across the spectrum of fibromyalgia. Notably, drugs like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and acetaminophen are generally not recommended due to limited efficacy and associated risks. Lastly, a variety of other medications have shown promise, including NMDA-receptor antagonists, naltrexone, and cannabinoids; however, they should be used with caution due to a small amount of evidence and potential for adverse effects.
